It is a carbon with two chlorines...however I notice the Carbon does not have the normal valency. It has a negative charge and an explicit hydrogen. So I should denote it by [CH-].

  "mol_12705621.png": "Ok, the user wants me to produce a valid smiles string for this compound. Hmm. I can go from left to right, making sure to add the correct parentheses whenever the stucture branches. Ok, so I see that there is a N triple bonded to C. So the answer starts with N#C. Continuing I see there is another C with two Fluorines, so it is followed by C(F)(F). Right now I am at N#CC(F)(F). Ok, continuing there is an O, and then a carbon with three fluorines. So it must end with OC(F)(F)F. So my answer is <answer>N#CC(F)(F)OC(F)(F)F</answer>",
  "mol_6101941.png": "Ok, I see there are two distinct compounds here. So I can determine their SMILES separately, and the final answer is the two SMILES separated by a period. Ok, starting with the bigger compound, I see it has a tin atom with a positive charge in the middle. It is symmetric. It has three ligands, which only seem to contain carbons. Let me count them...one, two, three, four. Ok, so there are three n-butyl groups attached to a [Sn+]. n-butyl is CCCC. Ok, so the first compound must be CCCC[Sn+](CCCC)CCCC. Ok, now moving onto the second compound. It seems to be simple, It is linear, so I can go from left to right. Ok, N, triple bond, carbon, sulphur with negative charge. So it is N#C[S-]. Ok so my final answer is <answer>CCCC[Sn+](CCCC)CCCC.N#C[S-]</answer>",
  "mol_148644.png": "Ok, so the user wants me to produce a smiles for this molecule I see. It does not seem to contain rings, so I can go in a linear fashion, left to right. Let me start with the hydroxyl group. So the smiles starts with O, since the hydrogen is implicit. Ok, so the OC...the C is connected to two flourines. So OC(F)(F). Then another carbon with two fluorines. So C(F)(F) again. And another one. But the molecule ends here, so I do not need to put the last F in parentheses. So OC(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)F. Ok, <answer>OC(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)F</answer>",

  "mol_136222.png": "Ok, so the user wants me to produce a smiles for this molecule I see. Let me think. I see that is is not containing any ring structures, so I can produce the SMILES by just going from left to right. Ok, I can ignore the hydrogens since they will be implied in this case. Ok, so I see carbon, carbon, oxygen, carbon...hmmm this carbon has two flourines, so I need a (F)(F) in my final answer. Ok, then I see one more carbon with a flourine and a bromine. So I just attach (F)Br to the end. So my answer is going from left to right... C... C... O... C(F)(F) ... C(F)Br <answer>CCOC(F)(F)C(F)Br</answer>",

I see that is is not containing any ring structures, so I can produce the SMILES by just going from left to right. Ok, so I see a chlorine, then a carbon which is double bonded to an oxygen, so I need C(=O). Then carbon, carbon with a methyl group so I need C(C). Then oxygen... carbon double bonded to Oxygen, then one more carbon. So my answer is Cl ... C(=O) .... C .. C(C) ... O ... C(=O) ... C <answer>ClC(=O)CC(C)OC(=O)C</answer>",
  "mol_12808786.png": "Ok, so the user wants me to produce a smiles for this molecule I see. Let me see...I see there is a ring in this compound. Let me count...let me count the atoms in the ring, clockwise, starting from the oxygen. Oxygen... carbon... double bond, carbon, nitrogen, double bond, carbon. Aha. This is an oxazole, which is an aromatic heterocycle. I know that the SMILES of oxazole is c1ncco1. Ok, but there are substituents in this compound, so I am not done yet.... what are the substituents. I see one is a methyl...the other is a carbon and then a Bromine so CBr... what are their positions? they are two part. The methyl is in between the nitrogen and the oxygen on the oxazole... ok..... Let me think. Oxazole is c1ncco1. The first c in this representation is the one between the n and o. Ok so the methyl is attached to it. Cc1ncco1... ok now where do I put the (CBr)... ah it goes after the c before the o. So my answer is <answer>Cc1ncc(CBr)o1</answer>",
  "mol_8024862.png": "Ok, so the user wants me to produce a smiles string for this compound...hmmm it is not linear, since it has a ring in it...hmmm, but the ring is at the end of the molecule, so I can figure out its structure, and then treat it as a subcomponent. Then I can just do the SMILES from left to right... Ok, going from left to right, I see carbon, carbon with methyl so C(C)... carbon ...nitrogen...and then the ring. So my answer is CC(C)CN(Ring). Ah, but I need to find the smiles of the ring. Hmmm. The ring is a one...two..three...four...five...six membered ring. Is it aromatic? No, I don't see any double bonds or other indications it would be. Also it has a hydroxy substituent at the para position. Ok, so it is C1CCC(O)CC1. So my answer is <answer>CC(C)CNC1CCC(O)CC1</answer>",
  "mol_4653272.png": "Ok, the user wants me to produce a smiles for this compound....I see that it has a ring. Let me count the right. Starting from the top and going clockwise...carbon..carbon with two methyls...oxygen...carbon...carbon...carbon with a long substituents and a hydroxyl group.... Ok, this ring cannot be aromatic...so my answer is C1C(C)(C)OCCC1(long substiuent)O. Oh, but I have to count the number of carbons in the long substituents... one...two...three...four...ok, so I just substitute in CCCC...ok so my answer is <answer>C1C(C)(C)OCCC1(CCCC)O</answer>",
  "mol_12482312.png": "Ok, the user wants me to produce a SMILES string for this compound...ok...hmmm looks like I see an ester and also an amine, but there are some substuents. Ah, that is called a carbamate. And there is just a cyclohexane as the substituent and a methyl connected to the ester. The smiles of a carbamate with an methyl substiuent on the ester would be.... CC(=O)ON. But there is a ring at the end. So I just add C1CCCCC1. Ok. the answer is <answer>CC(=O)ONC1CCCCC1</answer>",
  "mol_13584181.png": "Ok...so the user wants me to produce a SMILES string for the compound shown. It contains a ring. Let me count the ring counterclockwise.
